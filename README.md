Today's task was to Create a REST API to Manage a List of Books Using Node.js and Express.
First of all I had any knowledge about the REST API, Node.js & Express.
I used Copilot for the knowledge.And got a lot of idea about the topics.Still not clear properly, but tried to complete the task through the knowledge.
I got to know about API and to run it on the server through the commands providing in the command prompt.
I created a page 'server.js' which includes: (All these are CRUD operations)
                             1. Creating a new book using POST command.
                             2. Reading books using GET command.
                             3. Updating book using PUT command.
                             4. Deleting book using DELETE command.
                             5. Command to start the server.
I learn about Express which is the framewrok of Node.js and with its help we use (req,res) and not to be done manually.
I used the Browser to add,update & delete the books. But for testing API there are tools like POSTMAN,CURL,etc. Since I worked for the very first time so i used the Browser.
I had provided the code written to add , update & delete using browser in the text file 'CRUD.txt'.
Also provided the screenshots of every single step.
I initialize the API through the command prompt and created 'book-api' folder which consists this 'server.js' and also the page is run in Browser using the command running back in the command prompt. The command are: (Screenshot is provided)
                                        1. cd book-api   &     2. node server.js
